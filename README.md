# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

A human vs computer game of tic tac toe, built using Python 3. I made this project in order to practice and display 
a large portion of my knowledgebase as I learn more about Python. I hope to update this project in fun ways as I learn
more about the language. I plan to add features including a difficulty setting, a local leaderboard, and a save file 
using .txt files. I'm always excited to learn more efficient ways to implement the features of my code, so please feel 
free to give any suggestions on anything that was written amateurishly.
